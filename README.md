# MNIST dataset PCA then random forests and Logistic regression
in this project I am analyzing cleaning and visualizing the MNIST data set then after that I am doing dimensionality reduction using principle componant analysis then classification on it using random forests and Logistic regression by the following steps:
1. Data wrangling (Data gathering , Data assessing , Data cleaning).
2. Exploratory Data Analysis.
3. doing dimensionality reduction using principle componant analysis PCA then classifying the dataset using random forests and Logistic regression.
